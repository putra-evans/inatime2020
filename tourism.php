<!--                                <h3><a href="" class="style1">Lake Maninjau</a></h3>-->
<!--                                <p>Lake Maninjau, located in the Tanjung Raya sub-district of Agam Regency , about 140 kilometers north of Padang City and 36 km from Bukittinggi. Around 60,000 years ago, the Maninjau Purba volcano (Gunung Sitinjau) in West Sumatra erupted violently. This eruption spewed 220-250 cubic kilometers of volcanic spices which spread to a radius of 75 km from the center of the eruption. The Maninjau volcano which has developed in the Sumatran Fault zone is estimated to have erupted three times. Each eruption formed a caldera that connects each other to form Lake Maninjau as it is today. Three river terraces were found that indicate the three eruption periods. The first terrace is about 16 meters from the river bed. The second terrace rises up to 200 meters and there is no bedding. The third terrace is estimated above the 2nd terrace and has been eroded. Lake length is 16 km and the width is 7 km.-->
<!--Pensi (a type of clam) is one of the specific species of Lake Maninjau that can be enjoyed in local culinary offerings such as curry pensi. This specific culinary is very popular with tourists. To enjoy the beauty of Lake Maninjau can go through Kelok 44 which is a winding and uphill road between Maninjau Village and Morning Dew. Kelok 44 is a very challenging road route both uphill, derivative and bend which is the "Challenge of mountain" on the international event Tour de Singkarak.</p>-->

<!--                                <p>West Sumatra has a pure lake formed by tectonic activity, namely Lake Singkarak which is located in Tanah Datar District and Solok Regency.-->
<!--Lake Singkarak can be reached from Minangkabau International Airport (BIM) in two directions, namely through the city of Padang Panjang with a distance of 77 km in 2 (two) hours of travel, and through Solok with a distance of 92 km in 2.5 hours.-->
<!--This lake is part of the Singkarak-Solok elongated basin which is one of the Sumatran Big Fault segments. The large basin that extends is then blocked by the material of the eruption of young volcanoes, namely Merapi, Singgalang, and Tandikek on the northwest side and on the southeast side is dammed by the material deposition of Mount Talang eruption.-->
<!--Lake Singkarak presents a beautiful and culinary panorama that can be enjoyed with specific Fish Bilih (Mystacoleucus Padangensis Bleeker). Fish Bilih is an icon of Lake Singkarak that can be a souvenir for tourists. Bilih fish is an endemic fish of Lake Singkarak, measuring 2-5 cm with a savory taste. This species cannot be found anywhere else, even in the river flowing out of Lake Singkarak. Bilih fish has never been cultivated, develops naturally but can still be used as a source of life for the communities around the lake.</p>-->
